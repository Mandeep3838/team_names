The main motive of project is to provide emergency facilities during accidents and also inform the family of injured person.So we came up
 with a idea that when accident happens actually there is  a sudden change in acceleration in some cases as well as tilt angle in some cases
.So by making both as a parameter we can set our alarm system in a way to send message alert to emergency services so as to prevent mishap.
For this we connected GPS module,GSM module,MPU 6050 so that proper coordinates system can send the exact location connected to a user's 
mobile device.
